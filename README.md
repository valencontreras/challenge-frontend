# Challenge Frontend

This is the frontend for a challenge, built using Next.js. The project follows a modular architecture with TypeScript, emphasizing maintainability, scalability, and performance.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js — React framework for production-grade apps
- Tailwind CSS — Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- TypeScript — Static typing for JavaScript
- Modular folder structure (e.g., components, hooks, lib)
